# Collect data from São Paulo city

This repository contains a set of scripts that collect some data about São Paulo
city for future analysis. We use mongodb to store our date since we will collect
a huge amount of data and in some point we will need to scale this.

## Install dependencies

* ruby and bundler: ```$ apt install ruby bunler -qy```
* mongodb: ```$ apt install mongodb -qy```
* scripts' dependencies: ```$ bundle install --path vendor/```

If you have any problem during the scripts' dependencies installation, probably
your issue will be around the nokogiri's build dependencies. So install them too:

```$ apt install libxml2 zlib1g-dev libpq-dev```

## Configuration

* You need to create a database in your mongodb instace
	- Login in mongodb admin shell: ```$ mongo admin```
  - Create/use your database: ```> use sp```

If you use another name (not 'sp') in your database or your mongodb instance do
not run locally you need to set these configuration in seetings.yml file.

## Collect data

* Weather: ```$ bundle exec ruby weather.rb```
